# Angular Calendar Application

This project is a calendar application built from scratch using Angular, Angular Material, and the Angular CDK.

## Project Description

The goal of this Project was to create a functional calendar application using Angular 19. The application allows users to add, delete, update  and move calendar appointments, utilizing Angular Material for styling and the Angular CDK for drag-and-drop functionality.

**Key Requirements:**

* **Angular Only:** Implemented solely using Angular.
* **Angular Material & CDK:** Utilized Angular Material for styling and the Angular CDK for drag-and-drop.
* **Functionality:**
    * Form to add calendar appointments.
    * Ability to delete and update appointments.
    * Ability to move appointments using drag-and-drop.
    * Use of `Date()` for time/date manipulation.
    * `NgFor` for rendering calendar dates and appointments.
* **Advanced Angular Features:**
    * Dependency Injection.
    * Lazy loading for modules/routes.
    * Angular Router implementation (router, router-outlets, etc.).
    * Angular Forms with value changes, validators, etc.
    * RxJS usage.
    * Standalone components and/or shared modules.
    * Angular CDK Drag and Drop.

## Features

* **Add Appointment:** A form allows users to create new calendar appointments with date and time details.
* **Update Appointment:** Users can update existing appointments from the calendar.
* **Delete Appointment:** Users can delete existing appointments from the calendar.
* **Move Appointment:** Appointments can be moved to different dates using drag-and-drop.
* **Calendar View:** Displays calendar dates and appointments using `NgFor`.
* **Form Validation:** Angular forms with validators ensure data integrity.
* **Drag & Drop:** Implemented using Angular CDK for seamless appointment movement.
* **Routing:** The application uses Angular routing for navigation.
* **Lazy Loading:** Modules are lazy-loaded to improve performance.
* **RxJS:** Used for reactive programming where appropriate.
* **Standalone Components/Shared Modules:** The project utilizes standalone components and/or shared modules to promote code reusability.
